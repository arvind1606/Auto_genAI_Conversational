# Auto_genAI_Conversational
This repository contains code demonstrating the utilization of Language Models (LMs) for automating simulated interviews between two distinct personas. The primary objective is to showcase the capabilities of LMs in generating conversational exchanges, with one persona assuming the role of an interviewer and the other representing the candidate. Through this demonstration, we highlight the potential applications of LMs in simulating and analyzing interview scenarios, facilitating research and development in natural language processing (NLP) and conversational AI.
